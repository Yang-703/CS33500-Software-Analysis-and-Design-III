### Project 1 - Move Semantics in a Simulated File System ####

### Overview ### 

- This C++ project simulates a basic file system using `File` and `Folder` classes. The main objective was to implement and demonstrate mastery of the Big Five (copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment, move assignment, and destructor) through proper memory and resource management.

- The assignment emphasizes object-oriented programming, move semantics, and deep vs. shallow copy concepts. The classes were tested using `MyTests.cpp`.


### Requirements ### 

" In this assignment, you will implement a File class and a Folder class using the Big 5.

Following the comments in the .hpp files, write the function prototypes in the .hpp files and fully implement them in the .cpp files

Write your own tests in a file called MyTests.cpp, and submit that along with the provided files.

InvalidFormatException.hpp is included for your reference - you do not need to modify that file or submit it. We use it for testing but you don't have to.

The following files should be submitted: File.cpp, File.hpp, Folder.cpp, Folder.hpp, MyTests.cpp "
