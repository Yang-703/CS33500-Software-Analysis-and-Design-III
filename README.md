### Software Analysis and Design III (CS33500) ###

This repository contains three projects I completed for the Software Analysis and Design III course. The course focuses on the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms and the data structures they utilize.

### Course Overview ###

In this course, we studied advanced data structures and algorithms with an emphasis on both theoretical understanding and practical implementation, as well as exploring more complex structures including :
- Self-balancing trees
- Hash maps
- Heaps
- Sets
- Graphs

The course emphasized algorithmic analysis, efficiency, and writing well-organized code adhering to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++.

### Learning Outcome ###

By completing this course, I developed the ability to : 
- Understand how commonly used data structures work and the efficiency of their operations.
- Understand Abstract Data Types and their relationship to data structures.
- Design correct and efficient algorithms.
- Solve programming problems by evaluating multiple approaches and selecting the most efficient solution.

### Projects ###

- Project 1 : Move Semantics
Implemented a File and Folder class in C++ to simulate a simplified file system. The focus was practicing the Big 5 : copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator, move assignment operator, destructor. This project reinforced concepts in object-oriented programming and move semantics.

- Project 2 : Trees and Hashes
Extended the file system with two efficient search features. The first was a Ranged Search using an AVL tree to find files within a given size range. The second was a prefix search using a custom-built prefix trie, allowing case-insensitive lookups of filenames and extensions. This project demonstrated applied knowledge of balanced binary search trees, maps, and trie data structures. 

- Project 3 : Graphs Algorithms
Implemented the nearest neighbor heuristic for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem using C++. The algorithm generates a tour by visiting the nearest unvisited city at each step. The program was tested using real-world datasets of country-based TSPs and reinforced concepts in greedy algorithms, graph traversal, and runtime analysis.
